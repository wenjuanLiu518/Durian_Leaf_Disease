# Image augmentation by a vision-language foundation model for durian leaf disease recognition
This study employs a vision–language foundation model (FLUX) fine-tuned via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to generate realistic durian leaf disease images from paired textual descriptions. The objective is to enrich limited datasets with semantically faithful synthetic samples—capturing variations in lighting, weather, and background—thereby improving the accuracy of downstream disease classifiers. The basic pipeline of the proposed framework is as follows:
